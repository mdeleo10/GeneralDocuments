# IPv6 Azure Support
Is there IPv6 support in Azure? **Yes**. Mostly Infrastructure as a Service, but not many Platform as a Service. Curremtly no native IPv6 only networking is supported.

## Pricing

There's **no charge** to use Public IPv6 Addresses or Public IPv6 Prefixes. Associated resources and bandwidth are charged at the same rates as IPv4.

## Is the Azure Portal Dual Stacked?
Yes, the https://portal.azure.com site is dual-stacked, https://portal.azure.us is not. But the Azure Bash cli nor the Azure Powershell cli (ifconfig shows only ipv4 address) seem to support IPv6. Azure Powershell to be confirmed.

## Using Azure as Code:
* Using the infrastructure as code tools are dependant on the platform you are using in the first place. You need to support IPv6 and allow IPv6 connectivity out.
* Then the specific tool can have a dependancy on IPv6 support

### Is the AZ CLI IPv6 capable?
In short, the AZ CLI IPv6 capable
* AZ CLI is written in python and is dependant on python support, but python does support IPv6
* AZ Cli interracts with different URLS and will depend on their enablement - see [Azure CLI endpoints for proxy bypass](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-endpoints?tabs=azure-cloud)

### Is the AZ Powershell IPv6 capable?
Documentation needs to be research more as well as testing.
See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/az-powershell-proxy?view=azps-10.1.0

### Is the Azure ARM (Azure Resource Manager) IPv6 capable?
ARM can be deployed via the Azure Portal or Azure CLI or Powershell. See each section above about support.

### Is the Azure BICEP IPv6 capable?

### Is the Azure Terraform IPv6 capable?

Terraform for the Azure provider connects using both IPv4 and IPv6, but little documentation found at this time.

```bash
> terraform refresh
....
> netstat -vatWn

Limitations, see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/ipv6-overview

The current IPv6 for Azure Virtual Network release has the following limitations:
* VPN gateways currently support IPv4 traffic only, but they still can be deployed in a dual-stacked virtual network using Azure PowerShell and Azure CLI commands only.
* Dual-stack configurations that use floating IP can only be used with public load balancers, not internal load balancers.
* Application Gateway v2 doesn't currently support IPv6. It can operate in a dual stack virtual network using only IPv4, but the gateway subnet must be IPv4-only. Application Gateway v1 doesn't support dual stack virtual networks.
* IPv6-only Virtual Machines or Virtual Machines Scale Sets aren't supported, each NIC must include at least one IPv4 IP configuration.
* To add IPv6 to existing IPv4 deployments, you can't add IPv6 ranges to a virtual network that has existing resource navigation links.
* While it's possible to create NSG rules for IPv4 and IPv6 within the same NSG, it isn't currently possible to combine an IPv4 subnet with an IPv6 subnet in the same rule when specifying IP prefixes.
* ICMPv6 isn't currently supported in Network Security Groups.
* Azure Virtual WAN currently supports IPv4 traffic only.
* Azure Firewall doesn't currently support IPv6. It can operate in a dual stack VNet using only IPv4, but the firewall subnet must be IPv4-only.

Note: In my experience, deploying Marketplace solutions may not properly deploy on dual-stacked subnets.

Creating a dual-stacked VM - Note that *INTERNAL* IPv6 NIC address is address-translated to the Public IPv6 address for inbound and outbound Internet access. Remember that NAT-GW is not supported yet, so only one Public IP address is translated. If scalability is required, see Load Balancer as an option.
